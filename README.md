# IMDB Scraping Automation Project

This project automates the process of scraping data from IMDB using Python. The scraper collects detailed information about movies, TV shows, and other content available on the IMDB website. The entire process is automated, and a user-friendly **GUI** has been built using **Tkinter** for smooth interaction. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Automated Scraping**: The script scrapes a wide range of movie and TV show data, including titles, ratings, genres, cast, and more.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A simple, intuitive interface for users, built using **Tkinter**, where users can interact with the scraper.
- **Start Scraping**: A button in the GUI that begins the scraping process for IMDB data.
- **Start Automation**: Before scraping, users need to click "Start Automation" to initialize and configure the scraper.
- **Disclaimer & Debugging**: If the "Start Scraping" button is clicked before running "Start Automation," a disclaimer appears, instructing the user to first run "Start Automation." The GUI also provides helpful debugging messages for ease of use.
